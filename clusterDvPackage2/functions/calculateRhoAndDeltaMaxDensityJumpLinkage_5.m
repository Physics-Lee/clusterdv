%%%%%%%%%%%%% what this function does %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%1) calculates delta and rho using the maxJump density
%2) fixed for n dim
%4) max jump is fixed to be maxdensity - value - it gets more linear
%5) calculates density lines fast 
%6) calculates max jump using linkage



 function [rho,delta,maxjump,densityNorm] = calculateRhoAndDeltaMaxDensityJumpLinkage_5(data,nsamps,densityType,kdedens,linedensityMethod,numextra,doplot)
