%%%%%%%%%%%%% what this function does %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%1) it assigns every point to the closest higher rho point
%2) creates a halo and a core according to the dc
%3) its +- the density peak cluster paper implementation
 


function [clusterCore,clusterHalo] = assignPointsToClusters_1(distanceSquare,indClusterCenters,ordrho,nneigh,dc,rho)
