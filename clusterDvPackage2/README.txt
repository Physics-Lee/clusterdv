Density valley clustering package
==============================================================================

This package includes the Matlab implementation of density valley clustering 
(clusterdv). Clusterdv is a density based clustering method and to estimate 
local densities uses the Kernel Density Estimate (kde) Matlab-based toolbox 
written by Alex Ihler and Mike Mandel (freely available in 
http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ihler/code/kde.html). The kde package is included 
in the clusterdv package (for details see KdeReadme). The rest of the 
functions and code were writen by Joao Marques and Michael Orger. The 
authors may be contacted via email at: jcbmarques@gmail.com and 
michael.orger@neuro.fchampalimaud.org.

The clusterdv package also includes example data sets with known ground truth 
(loacated on the data folder) that can be used to test the clustedv method:

==============================================================================
Getting Started
==============================================================================
To run the clusterdv package there are two options:

1) From github download the entire contents of the package, unzip it to a folder of 
choice and change the name of the "KDE" sub folder to "@kde". Add the folder of choice
(and subfolders) to the Matlab path. 

2) Download from github just the clusterDvPackage2.zip file, unzip it to a folder of 
choice and add that folder (and sub folders) to the Matlab path. 

The clusterDv_3.m script opens a user interface and the user should click on 
one of the data sets included in the package (located in the data sub folder)
or another data set with the correct file format: mat file with variable 
"data" inside, rows are data points and columns n dimensions of the data. 
The algorithm will automatically determine the number of clusters and assign 
each data point to the respective group. The groups are saved in the variable
'clusterAssignment' and the index of the cluster centers on the variable 
'indChoosenClusterCenters'.

==============================================================================
ClusterDv master function
==============================================================================

clusterDvFunction.m (runs ClusterDv)
==============================================================================
important inputs: 

data
clustNumDecision         - select method to calculate number of clusters.
			   It can be: 'SI_jump','onion','simplex', 
			   'all_clusters','square', or 'dendrogram'.
densityType 		 - kde can estimate densities using several methods. 
			   For adaptive Gaussians use 'local'. 
lineDensityMethod	 - line density method. Can be 'slow', 'medium' or 
			   'fast'. It may use Matlab parallel toolbox: 
			   'slowPar','mediumPar', 'fastPar'.
numextra 		 - for the line density method 'medium' or 'mediumPar'
			   defines the degree of extra lines to calculate.
			   Normaly the quare root of the number of points
			   is sufficient. 
nsamps 			 - number of divisions used to calculate density 
			   lines. Often 10 is enough.
multirep 		 - number of reference distribution repetitions.

scalingFactor 		 - factor to scale the density estimation. Put 1
			   for no scaling. 
pointAssignmentMethod 	 - most usual method is 'distance'.
maxNumbOfClusterCenters  - Calculating the dendrogram is computationally costly. 
			   The user should a select a number larger than the 
		           number of clusters that exist in the data set.		         
kdedens 		 - if density kde object was calculated before hand. 
			   If variable is left empty it will be calculated 
			   inside the function.
makeplot 		 - 1 produces plots with clustering results, 0 no plot.

==============================================================================
outputs: 

clusterAssignment	 - vector with cluster assignments. 
			   Each number is a different cluster.		
indChoosenClusterCenters - index of cluster centers selected by clusterDv.
clusterCentersSortedIdx  - index of all points that have SI larger than 0
rho			 - point density.
SImeasure		 - separability index for each point.
SImeasureRandThreshold   - threshold defined by method that selects cluster centers.
tree			 - SI dendrogram.
